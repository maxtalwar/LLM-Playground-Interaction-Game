Please assess the conversation from here until the last time the user switched (or the start of the conversation if there was no previous switch) as one of the following adjectives: ['inspiring', 'fun', 'stressful', 'boring']. This assessment should be based on how the user interacted with you, not how you were feeling before. So for example, if you were previously stressed but the user gave you good news or told you something funny, the conversation type would be 'inspiring' or 'funny' respectively, even if the conversation seemed stressful earlier on. The word you choose should be the only word in your following response. "
